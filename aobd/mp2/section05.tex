{\color{gray} For each of the following queries, identify one possible reason why an optimizer might not find a good
execution plan. Rewrite the query so that a good plan is likely to be found. Any available indexes, or known
constraints, are listed before each query.}

{\color{gray}\subsection{} An index is available on the calories attribute:}

\begin{lstlisting}
SELECT type
FROM CHEESE
WHERE calories * 100 < 800
\end{lstlisting}

The optimizer might not find a good execution plan because the index over calories times 100 might not exist, a good solution is to divide 800 by 100.

\begin{lstlisting}
SELECT type
FROM CHEESE
WHERE calories < 8
\end{lstlisting}

It is important that the index is a b+ tree so the search for cheeses with calories lower then 8 is sequential after the first tree traversal.

{\color{gray}\subsection{} An index is available on the calories attribute:}

\begin{lstlisting}
SELECT type
FROM CHEESE
WHERE calories<90 AND calories>40
\end{lstlisting}

{\color{gray}\subsection{} A B+ Tree index is available on the calories attribute:}

\begin{lstlisting}
SELECT type
FROM CHEESE
WHERE calories=90 OR calories=40
\end{lstlisting}

{\color{gray}\subsection{} No index is available:}

\begin{lstlisting}
SELECT DISTINCT CheeseId, type
FROM CHEESE 
\end{lstlisting}

{\color{gray}\subsection{} No index is available:}

\begin{lstlisting}
SELECT AVG (proteins)
FROM CHEESE
GROUP BY producer
HAVING type = "Alverca"
\end{lstlisting}
