{\color{gray} Consider the two relations of Question 4. Consider also the following information, regarding the two relations:}

\tab {\color{gray} $V(climate,Location)=20$}

{\color{gray} Estimate the number of tuples that results from the expression:}

\tab {\color{gray} $CheeseProvenance \bowtie(\sigma_{climate='dry'} Location)$}

For $\sigma_{climate='dry'} Location$
 
\tab 2300 Location blocks

\tab 100 Tuples for each Location block

\tab $n_{Location} = 2300 \times 100 = 230000 $

\tab $n_{Dry Location} = \frac{n_{Location}}{ V(climate, Location)}=\frac{230000}{20} = 11500 $

% R ∩ S in S is a foreign key in S referencing R
$Location ∩ CheeseProvenance$ is a foreign key in $CheeseProvenance$ referencing $Location$ implies that the number of tuples resulting from $Location \bowtie CheeseProvenance$ is exactly the same as the number of tuples in $CheeseProvenance$
 
\tab 1000 CheeseProvenance blocks

\tab 120 Tuples for each CheeseProvenance block

\tab $n_{CheeseProvenance} = 1000 \times 120 = 120000 $

We know that, $(\sigma_{climate='dry'} Location) \bowtie CheeseProvenance$ produces the same results as $\sigma_{climate='dry'} (Location \bowtie CheeseProvenance)$

\tab $n_{Result} = \frac{n_{CheeseProvenance}}{ V(climate, Location)}=\frac{120000}{20} = 6000 $
